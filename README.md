# raytrace
This repository is intended to archive my raytracing project done in 2018-1 CG class.<br/>
This project uploads entire Visual Studio project, and is intended to run in x86 since it only includes x86 freeglut library.<br/>

# Example
Included code as is features 3 spheres under 3 different light source in the reflective room, with x9 anti-alising.<br/>
Since this code uses only CPUs, rendering may take a while. Please check the command prompt to check the progress, and run under 'release' mode (not 'debug') for faster rendering.
